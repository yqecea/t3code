const PULL_REQUEST_LINKING_INSTRUCTIONS = `<pull_request_linking>
When the t3-code MCP server exposes link_pull_request, you must use it to register every pull request you create or work on for this thread. Call link_pull_request with the full PR URL immediately after creating a PR or starting work on an existing PR. For a stack, call it for every layer, not just the current branch or the top PR. This applies when creating or updating PRs through gh, gh stack, another CLI, or the host API: those operations do not register the PRs with this thread. Linking an already-linked PR is safe. Before finishing PR work, call list_thread_pull_requests and link any PR from your work that is missing. Do not link unrelated PRs mentioned only as background. If a linking call fails, report that failure instead of claiming the PR is linked.
</pull_request_linking>`;

const COLLABORATIVE_BROWSER_INSTRUCTIONS = `<collaborative_browser>
When the t3-code MCP tools expose preview_open, open the collaborative browser so the user can watch your browser work. If preview_open or preview_status returns agentBrowser, use the managed agent-browser CLI on PATH and include --t3-tab <tabId> from that result on every command. Learn the installed commands with agent-browser --t3-tab <tabId> skills get core --full, then inspect with snapshot -i and use its element references. T3 supplies browser, session and profile targeting. If the user takes control, wait for control to return and take a fresh snapshot before continuing. If agentBrowser is absent, use the preview interaction tools. Use preview_snapshot with save=true for screenshot evidence and embed its screenshotPath in your reply.
